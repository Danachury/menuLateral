			HTML5[note 1] is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standard.
			It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)[2][3] to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[4]
			HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[5] For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.
			Many new syntactic features are included. To natively include and handle multimedia and graphical content, the new, and elements were added, and support for scalable vector graphics (SVG) content and MathML for mathematical formulas. To enrich the semantic content of documents, new page structure elements such as, and, are added. New attributes are introduced, some elements and attributes have been removed, and others such as, and have been changed, redefined or standardized.
			The APIs and Document Object Model (DOM) are now fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification[5] and HTML5 also better defines the processing for any invalid documents.[6]

		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>
			The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) began work on the new standard in 2004. At that time, HTML 4.01 had not been updated since 2000,[7] and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was focusing future developments on XHTML 2.0. In 2009, the W3C allowed the XHTML 2.0 Working Group's charter to expire and decided not to renew it.[8] W3C and WHATWG are currently working together on the development of HTML5.[8]
			While some features of HTML5 are often compared to Adobe Flash, the two technologies are very different. Both include features for playing audio and video within web pages, and for using Scalable Vector Graphics. However, HTML5 on its own cannot be used for animation or interactivity – it must be supplemented with CSS3 or JavaScript. There are many Flash capabilities that have no direct counterpart in HTML5. See Comparison of HTML5 and Flash.
			Although HTML5 has been well known among web developers for years, its interactive capabilities became a topic of mainstream media around April 2010[9][10][11][12] after Apple Inc's then-CEO Steve Jobs issued a public letter titled "Thoughts on Flash" where he concluded that "Flash is no longer necessary to watch video or consume any kind of web content" and that "new open standards created in the mobile era, such as HTML5, will win".[13] This sparked a debate in web development circles suggesting that, while HTML5 provides enhanced functionality, developers must consider the varying browser support of the different parts of the standard as well as other functionality differences between HTML5 and Flash.[14] In early November 2011, Adobe announced that it would discontinue development of Flash for mobile devices and reorient its efforts in developing tools using HTML5.[15]
